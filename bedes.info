  ; "core" specifies the version of Drupal that this theme is compatible with.
  ; "base theme" specifies that this is a theme that uses the "zen" theme as its
  ; base theme. Its unlikely you will ever need to change these, but they are
  ; required fields for a Zen sub-theme. The "engine" field is not used in a
  ; sub-theme since the engine is inherited from its base theme.

  ; This section adds CSS files to your theme. The media type is specified in
  ; the brackets. Typical CSS media types include "all", "screen", "print", and
  ; "handheld". See http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/media.html#media-types for a full
  ; list of stylesheet media types in CSS 2.1. The iPhone's preferred media type
  ; is based on the CSS3 Media queries. http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/
  ;
  ; You can also override any of Zen's stylesheets or any module's stylesheets,
  ; an /extremely/ useful feature. See the excellent Drupal 6 Theme Guide at
  ; http://drupal.org/node/171209 for more details.

  ; variable in the page.tpl.php file.) The text after the equals sign is a
  ; descriptive text used on the admin/build/blocks page.

  ; To add a new region, copy Zen's page.tpl.php to your sub-theme's directory,
  ; add a line line to this file, and then add the new variable to your
  ; page.tpl.php template.
